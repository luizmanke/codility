# Python Codility Solutions

These are my current solutions to Codility exercises and tests.

Most of the tasks were straightforward and the available time was more than enough.
However few took me awhile to reach 100%.

All tasks and solutions are sorted into the appropriate lessons, exactly as codility organizes them.
